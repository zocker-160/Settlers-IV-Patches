# Settlers IV Widescreen Fix
Proper Widescreen Fix for Settlers IV Gold Edition.

Yes I am aware that [Settlers4-Widescreen-Tool](https://github.com/FireEmerald/Settlers4-Widescreen-Tool) by [FireEmerald](https://github.com/FireEmerald) exists, but it has a few limitations which I managed to fix.
The two most important being:

- resolutions are not limited to a fixed list, you can use whatever the heck you want
- resolution does not get fucked up, when changing graphics options like texture quality or texture filterings

I also found a way to make the custom resolutions show in the in game GUI of the resolution selector.

## Installation

- download patch archive from [releases](https://github.com/zocker-160/Settlers-IV-Patches/releases)
- unpack it
- copy the files into the `Exe` folder where the `S4_Main.exe` is
- (optional) edit the .ini file as you desire
